            <h2>What is Scratch?</h2>
            <p>Scratch is a block-based visual programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab. It is designed primarily for ages 8-16 to learn programming concepts without the complexity of syntax found in traditional text-based languages.</p>
            
            <p>In Scratch, users create programs by dragging and connecting graphical blocks together, rather than typing code. This approach eliminates syntax errors and allows beginners to focus on the logic and structure of programming.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Scratch is free to use and can be accessed through a web browser at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a> or downloaded as an offline editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>History and Development</h2>
            <p>Scratch was created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, led by Mitchel Resnick. It was first released to the public in 2007.</p>
            
            <p>The name "Scratch" comes from the scratching technique used by hip-hop DJs, who spin vinyl records back and forth with their hands to mix music. Like DJs, Scratch programmers can mix different media (graphics, photos, music, sounds) by combining programming blocks.</p>
            
            <h3>Major Versions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scratch 1.4 (2009)</strong>: Downloadable application</li>
                <li><strong>Scratch 2.0 (2013)</strong>: Web-based platform with improved features</li>
                <li><strong>Scratch 3.0 (2019)</strong>: Redesigned interface, new extensions, and better support for mobile devices</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why Scratch is Ideal for STEM Education</h2>
            <p>Scratch embodies what Mitchel Resnick calls the "low floor, high ceiling, wide walls" approach to learning tools:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Floor</strong>: Easy to get started with minimal prior knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>High Ceiling</strong>: Supports the creation of increasingly complex projects</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Walls</strong>: Enables diverse types of projects to appeal to different interests</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Scratch offers several advantages for STEM education:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminates syntax errors through visual programming</li>
                <li>Provides immediate feedback for experimentation</li>
                <li>Integrates mathematics, science, and engineering concepts</li>
                <li>Encourages creativity and personalization</li>
                <li>Supports collaborative learning</li>
                <li>Develops computational thinking skills</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Scratch projects can directly relate to various STEM subjects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematics</strong>: Geometry, coordinates, variables, logic</li>
                <li><strong>Science</strong>: Simulations, data visualization, modeling</li>
                <li><strong>Engineering</strong>: Design process, problem-solving, optimization</li>
                <li><strong>Technology</strong>: Programming concepts, digital literacy, user interface design</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Scratch Community</h2>
            <p>Scratch is not just a programming language but also a vibrant online community where users can share projects, remix others' work, and collaborate.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Over 100 million registered users worldwide</li>
                <li>More than 90 million shared projects</li>
                <li>Available in 70+ languages</li>
                <li>Strong culture of sharing and remixing</li>
                <li>Supportive community with feedback mechanisms</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The community aspect of Scratch provides valuable opportunities for students to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn from others' projects</li>
                <li>Receive feedback on their work</li>
                <li>Collaborate with peers</li>
                <li>Develop communication skills</li>
                <li>Build confidence in sharing their creations</li>
            </ul>
