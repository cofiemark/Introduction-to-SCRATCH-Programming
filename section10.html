            <h2>Assessment in Scratch Programming</h2>
            <p>Assessing student learning in Scratch programming requires approaches that go beyond traditional testing. Project-based assessment allows educators to evaluate not just what students know, but what they can create and how they think.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Assessment Principles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process-Oriented</strong>: Evaluate the development process, not just the final product</li>
                <li><strong>Authentic</strong>: Assess through real-world projects and applications</li>
                <li><strong>Formative</strong>: Provide ongoing feedback throughout the learning process</li>
                <li><strong>Reflective</strong>: Encourage students to reflect on their own learning</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong>: Consider technical skills, creativity, and computational thinking</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In this section, we'll explore strategies for assessing student learning in Scratch programming and tracking their progression through increasingly complex concepts.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Project-Based Assessment</h2>
            <p>Project-based assessment evaluates student learning through the creation of Scratch projects that demonstrate their understanding and skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Assessment Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Rubrics</strong>: Define clear criteria for evaluating projects</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Assessment</strong>: Evaluate a collection of projects over time</li>
                <li><strong>Peer Review</strong>: Have students evaluate each other's work</li>
                <li><strong>Project Presentations</strong>: Ask students to explain their projects and process</li>
                <li><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: Examine the scripts students create for efficiency and clarity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Sample Project Rubric Categories:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: Does the project work as intended?</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Does the project use appropriate programming concepts?</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity</strong>: Does the project show original thinking?</li>
                <li><strong>Design</strong>: Is the project visually appealing and user-friendly?</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Is the project well-explained and commented?</li>
                <li><strong>Process</strong>: Did the student follow an effective development process?</li>

            <p>Debugging—finding and fixing errors in code—is an essential skill in programming. Assessing students' debugging abilities provides insight into their problem-solving skills and understanding of programming concepts.</p>
            
            <h3>Debugging Assessment Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bug-Finding Exercises</strong>: Provide code with intentional errors for students to identify</li>
                <li><strong>Fix-It Tasks</strong>: Give students broken projects to repair</li>
                <li><strong>Error Explanation</strong>: Ask students to explain why errors occur and how to fix them</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging Process Documentation</strong>: Have students document their debugging process</li>
                <li><strong>Peer Debugging</strong>: Have students find and fix errors in each other's projects</li>
